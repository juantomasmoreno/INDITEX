# INDITEX
## Automating informative product descriptions - using generative AI

INDITEX sells more than a billion products each year worldwide, among all their different brands. This iswhy putting each and every one of their products into words is becoming a harder task over the years, with a rocketing time cost. What could the company do to reduce it?

We propose a solution to this problem: generating semi-automatic descriptions of the products, using their images and some basic features.
